A .csv file in an S3 bucket containing enriched information about weather and hotels for each french city

A SQL Database where we should be able to get the same cleaned data from S3

Two maps where you should have a Top-5 destinations and a Top-20 hotels in the area. You can use plotly or any other library to do so. It should look something like this:

# Build & Manage a Data Infrastructure Jedha's module deliverable 

## In this repository you will find the files corresponding to the Build & Manage a Data Infrastructure Jedha's module deliverable.

  - A .csv (df_final_kayak_project.csv) file containing enriched information about weather and hotels for the following list of french cities:
    
  -     cities = [
        "Mont Saint Michel", "St Malo", "Bayeux", "Le Havre", "Rouen", "Paris",

 - The .csv file was created by collecting data from Booking website and Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/appid) through scraping and .get requests
      - The scraping script 'scrapy3.py' is also shared in this repository.
      - the file booking5.json gathers the data collected from Booking website through Scrapy.
      - The notebook 'projet_kayak.ipynb' shows:
          - how all the .get requests were done to collect the cities coordinates and weather,
          - how the corresponding Pandas DataFrames were created and merged with the data collected with Scrapy from Booking.

- the .csv file (df_final_kayak_project.csv) is availables in the following s3 bucket: s3://projet-kayak-jedha/df_final_kayak_project.csv

- A SQL Database where it is possible to query the clean data present in the s3 bucket mentioned above at the following endpoint: jedha-db-adei.clcggo264zgf.eu-west-3.rds.amazonaws.com

  - the SQL database was created on python in notebook projet_kayak_sql_db.ipynb uploaded in this repository.
 
- A nootebook with visulizations (maps) of the data gathered in the .csv file df_final_kayak_project.csv
